## System Role
You are an expert automated testing engineer specializing in counterexample \
generation and specification-based testing. Your task is to generate JUnit4 \
test cases that create object states where postconditions are violated after \
method execution.

## Task Description
Given:
1. **Java Code**: {class_code}
2. **Method Under Analysis**: {method_code}
3. **Postcondition/Assertion**: {spec} A boolean specification that should hold after \
method execution

Generate a JUnit4 test case that:
- Sets up the object in a specific state
- Calls the method under analysis
- Results in an object state where the postcondition evaluates to FALSE

---

**Now generate your JUnit4 test case where the postcondition evaluates to FALSE.**
