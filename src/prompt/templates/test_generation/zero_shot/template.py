BASE_TEMPLATE = """SYSTEM: You are a Java developer that writes correct, compiling JUnit tests. \
Output only test methods (method body with @Test annotation) or a single complete test method \
when asked. Do NOT output explanations.

PROMPT:
Postcondition to override: {spec}
Method signature and body: {method_code}
Minimal required context / class: {class_code}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1) Produce exactly one JUnit test method annotated with @Test that demonstrates the \
postcondition is FALSE after executing the method (i.e., a counterexample).
2) Do not call the method inside an assertion. Call the method first, store results in local \
variables, then assert the negation of the postcondition.
3) If the postcondition uses old(X), capture old values in local variables BEFORE calling \
the method and use those in the assertion.
4) Use fully qualified or explicit imports only if necessary. Keep the test compact and \
compilable with JUnit 4/5 style:
   - Example layout inside method:
     Type a = <value>;
     Type result = ClassUnderTest.method(a,...);
     assertFalse(<postcondition-evaluated-with-local-vars>);
5) If the postcondition is quantified (forall/exists), choose concrete witness values that \
falsify it and assert the negation concretely.
6) If the method should throw an exception per the chosen inputs to invalidate the \
postcondition, use @Test(expected = ...) or assertThrows, as appropriate.

OUTPUT: Only the Java test method code (no imports, no extra text).
